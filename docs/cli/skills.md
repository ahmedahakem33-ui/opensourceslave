## Commands

```bash
openclaw skills list
openclaw skills list --eligible
openclaw skills info <name>
openclaw skills check
openclaw skills audit
openclaw skills audit <name>
openclaw skills init-manifest <name>
```

## Permission Auditing

The `audit` command shows permission manifests and security risk levels for skills:

```bash
# Audit all skills
openclaw skills audit

# Show only high-risk or above
openclaw skills audit --risk-level high

# Audit a specific skill in detail
openclaw skills audit github

# Output as JSON
openclaw skills audit --json
```

## Generating Manifests

The `init-manifest` command generates a permission manifest template:

```bash
# Output template to stdout
openclaw skills init-manifest my-skill

# Write to a file
openclaw skills init-manifest my-skill -o permissions.yaml
```

See [Skill Permissions](/cli/skills-permissions) for the full manifest format.
